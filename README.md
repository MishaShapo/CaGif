Health Games Revolutionized

##Health Games Revolutionized
Walk with your phone and earn PawPoints for each step you take.
Buy merchandise for your pet kitty and stash goodies in your backpack. 
Be sure to check back regularly to feed your feline friend. 

##Technologies Utilized
This app was built using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Apple Health Kit](https://developer.apple.com/reference/healthkit), and [React-Redux](http://redux.js.org). It uses a native Objective-C module to expose the Apple HealthKit
API to the React logic-side JS. Redux is used to manage and save state across the application. [BuddyBuild](https://www.buddybuild.com) is used to beta-testing and continuous integration deployment.

##Read About It
While building this app, I blogged my experiences as well as problems/solutions at [my personal portfolio](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mps/).
